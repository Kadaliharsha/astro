Step 1 : 

Calculation of PN and DN

Step 2 : 

Considering of compatible planets of PN and DN (CCN) 

Step 3 : 

Considering the KPN of the industry and its values 
Comparing it with the compatible planets of PN and DN

Step 4 : 

If any KPN value has the same number as of the compatible planet number so it can be considered as the favorable name number

*Note : the CCN 4, 8 should completely rejected
  	
(or) 

If there are no compatible planets for KPN then we consider the CCN of the owners and check them against the final numbers 1,3,5,6.

(If there are 2 or more owners then we should consider the CCN.
If there is a single owner then we should consider the PN and DN of the owner.)


Example : 

Company RM Enterprises - 8 (Not compatible)
